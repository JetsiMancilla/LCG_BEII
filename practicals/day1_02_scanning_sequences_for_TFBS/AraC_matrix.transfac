FF  The arabinose regulator, AraC, is a transcription factor that regulates transcription of several genes and operons involved in arabinose catabolism and transport; It coregulates with another transcriptional regulator, CRP; both are transcription factors involved in l-arabinose degradation; These regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of five operons related to transport, catabolism, and autoregulation of l-arabinose; Transcription of these operons is induced when E. coli is grown in the absence of glucose and when the physiological inducer, l-arabinose, binds to the AraC regulator; In the absence of glucose, cellular cyclic AMP levels are high and cyclic AMP forms a dimeric complex with CRP to coregulate with AraC Gallegos MT,1997; Reeder T,1991; Stoner C,1983; Hendrickson W,1992; Seabold RR,1998; Hendrickson W,1990; Miyada CG,1984AraC binds to five target sites in the araBp region; AraC binds to the less-conserved site (-42.5) with less strength; this binding occurs only in the 
presence of arabinose, and it is absolutely required for expression of araBp Lobell RB,1990; Hamilton EP,1988; Lee N,1987; Martin K,1986; Carra JH,1993 AraC binding to the distal site (-123.5) has been shown to down-regulate expression of araBp and araCp Lee DH,1992; Hamilton EP,1988 In the absence of arabinose, AraC is unable to activate araBp, but it regulates its own expression by repressing araCp and araBp simultaneously Lobell RB,1990; Martin K,1986 Arabinose triggers AraC-dependent activation of araBp and relieves AraC-dependent repression of araCp Hamilton EP,1988; Martin K,1986 The araBAD operon is located upstream of araC and in the opposite direction.In the presence of arabinose, this regulator activates transcription by overlapping the -35 box of the core promoters, and the central position of the binding site is located near bp -41.5; The binding targets for AraC consist of 17-nucleotide-long direct repeat sequences that possess conserved motifs; each monomer binds to one of these conserved 
sequences Gallegos MT,1997; Niland P,1996 The AraC regulator belongs to the AraC/XylS family and occurs as both a monomer and a homodimer; It is composed of two domains; The solution structure of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain has been solved; It consists of two helix-turn-helix regions connected by an &alpha;-helix Rodgers ME,2009 The N-terminal domain is responsible for dimerization and L-arabinose binding Gallegos MT,1997; Gallegos MT,1993 Its crystal structure Soisson SM,1997; Soisson SM,1997reveals that the sugar molecule is bound within a &beta;-barrel, buried by the N-terminal arm of the protein; It has been suggested that this N-terminal arm plays a key role in the regulation of the arabinose-dependent DNA-binding properties of the protein; In the absence of arabinose it interacts with the DNA-binding domain and constrains this domain, and it releases it in the presence of arabinose Soisson SM,1997; Rodgers ME,2009 This interaction appears to be affected by a mutation in the interdomain linker
