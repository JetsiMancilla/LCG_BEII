## Introduction

We saw that there are many peak callers, and that the number of peaks varies depending on some parametric choices. How to evaluate the choices ?

A variety of approaches could be envisaged to deal with this question:


1. **Significance**


    - Compare discovered motif significance in actual peak with random genomic regions of the same sizes.

2. **Consistency**

    - Compare peak sets returned by different peak callers
    Motif analysis
    
3. **Motif enrichment**

    - Compare the enrichment of the different peak sets for the reference motif
    - If no available reference motif: compare relative enrichment for discovered motifs

4. **Peak annotation**

    - Check the fraction of peaks in genomic regions compatible with regulation (promoters, introns)
    - Eukaryotes: compare peak sets with histone marks associated with enhancers
    - Bacteria/Fungi: evaluate the phylogenetic conservation of predicted binding sites (phylogenetic footprints)

5. Comparison with a **golden standard dataset**

    - If a reference collection of sites is available, evaluate the overlap. Note: we can only evaluate the sensitivity, not the specificity since all site databases are incomplete.

## Goal of the homework

Each student should choose one of the two chips-seq datasets seen during the course.

1. Escherichia coli FNR 
2. Arabidopsis thaliaba MYB3R

The goal of the homework is to combine a subset of the approaches listed above in order to  compare two peak-calling results, and evaluate their respective relevance.  

The comparison can take various modalities:

- comparison between two programs (e.g. SWEMBL vs MACS2) 
- comparison between peaksets returned by the same program with different parameter values
- analysis of the "depth" of the peak set: evalution of the relevance of the peaks depending on their scores (available in the bed files).

Note: no one is expected to perform all the comparisons between all peaksets with each of the approaches listed above. Rather, I ask each one to select a few peak sets and one or two approaches. 


## Datasets

The datasets are available on the server of the training (tepeu) in the root of the rsat user account.

- ~rsat/FNR_Ecoli_chip-seq
- ~rsat/Athaliana-Myb

Each of these folders contains several Gigabytes of files organized in folders and sub-folders. Since you do not need the complete file sructure for your work, we indicate hereby a command that allows you to get the list of all the peak coordinates (.bed files) and peak sequences (.fasta files).

### E.coli FNR chip-seq

```
## Peak coordinate files
find ~rsat/FNR_Ecoli_chip-seq/results/GSM1010219_vs_GSM1010224 -name '*.bed'

## Peak sequence files corresponding to the bed files
find ~rsat/FNR_Ecoli_chip-seq/results/GSM1010219_vs_GSM1010224 -name '*.bed' | perl -pe 's|\.bed$|.fasta|' | xargs ls -1
```

### A.thaliana MYB3R chip-seq

```
## Peak coordinate files
find ~rsat/Athaliana-Myb/GSM1482283_vs_GSM1482284/ -name '*.bed'

## Peak sequence files corresponding to the bed files
## (ignore the bed files with no associated fasta)
find ~rsat/Athaliana-Myb/GSM1482283_vs_GSM1482284/ -name '*.bed' | perl -pe 's|\.bed$|.fasta|' | xargs ls -1
```
