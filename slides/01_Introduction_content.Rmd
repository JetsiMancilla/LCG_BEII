## Scope of the course


1. Detection of cis-regulatory elements and other types of nucleic sequence motifs.

2. Applications to Next Generation Sequencing data about regulation

    - ChIP-seq for transcription factors
    - ChIP-seq for chromating marks (histone acetylation, methylation)
    - RNA-seq (differentially expressed genes)
        
3. Underlying statistics


## Statistics

1. Topics

    - Statistics of motif detection
    - NGS statistics (read mapping, peak calling, differential expression)
      
2. Approach

    - Minimalist theoretical elements
    - Intuitive approach to the statisics: lots of graphs, simulations, controls

3. Environment

    - R statistical language (<https://www.r-project.org/>)
    - Bioconductor: (<https://www.bioconductor.org/>)
    - Environment: RStudio (<https://www.rstudio.com/>)

## Technical skills

- Writing reports in R markdown (<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>)

- Version management with git (<https://git-scm.com/>)
      - see @Blischak:2016kr
